## 🧠 Analytical Approach

- 📚 **Data Understanding:** Reviewed column-level data and identified key variables (Sales, Ratings, Item Types, Tiers, etc.)  
- 🧹 **Data Cleaning:** Standardized `Item_Fat_Content` categories to avoid inconsistencies (`LF` / `low fat` → `Low Fat`, `reg` → `Regular`)  
- 🧮 **KPI Computation:** Used SQL aggregate functions, Excel formulas, and DAX in Power BI to derive insights  
- 📊 **Visualization Strategy:** Built clean, business-ready dashboards with filters, trend charts, and category comparisons  
- 🎯 **Insight Extraction:** Identified performance patterns impacting revenue and customer satisfaction

## 📈 Key SQL Queries

**Data Cleaning:**
```sql
UPDATE new_data
SET item_fat_content =
    CASE
        WHEN item_fat_content IN ('LF', 'low fat') THEN 'Low Fat'
        WHEN item_fat_content = 'reg' THEN 'Regular'
        ELSE item_fat_content
    END;
```

**KPI Calculations:**
```sql
-- Total Sales
SELECT ROUND(SUM(sales)) AS Total_Sales FROM new_data;

-- Average Sales
SELECT ROUND(AVG(sales), 2) AS Avg_Sales FROM new_data;

-- Number of Items
SELECT COUNT(item_identifier) AS Count_Of_Items FROM new_data;

-- Average Rating
SELECT ROUND(AVG(rating), 2) AS Average_Rating FROM new_data;
```

**Segmentation Examples:**
```sql
-- Sales by Fat Content
SELECT item_fat_content, ROUND(SUM(sales)) AS Total_Sales
FROM new_data
GROUP BY item_fat_content
ORDER BY Total_Sales DESC;

-- Sales by Outlet Type
SELECT outlet_type, ROUND(SUM(sales)) AS Total_Sales
FROM new_data
GROUP BY outlet_type
ORDER BY Total_Sales DESC;
```
